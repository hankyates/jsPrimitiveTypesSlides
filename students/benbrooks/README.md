### Client-Side Engineer


I am currently a ~~front-end developer~~ client-side engineer at [Grist](http://grist.org). While I know my way around HTML, CSS and jQuery, I am excited to learn rock solid JavaScript skills and the art and science of building interactive web apps! I have dabbled a bit with ![Angular](http://cdn3.icicletech.com/media/t_logo-angularjs-transparent.png) and can't wait to configure my first ![Node](http://developwithguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/nodejs-logo.png) server.
