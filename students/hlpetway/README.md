#Hailey Petway

##Hi my name is Hailey. 

##I enjoy:
1. [_cat snuggles_](http://pinkbluelovescute.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Cats-snuggling-on-the-couch.jpeg) and 
2. long walks on the beach. 

###I'm learning JavaScript so that I can create super cool web apps. 
My goal is to be hired at the end of the Javascript bootcamp. I have already applied and I will be accepted pending 
my success in this course. I've been studying on my own prior to taking this course. I especially enjoyed the Codecademy jQuery course.
