**About me:**

I am currently working for the Seattle YCMA and have been doing help desk support for the past year. I spent the 4 years prior to that working as an aquatics manager for the Y.

I have been learning to code for about 2 - 2.5 years and have taken the ruby certificate program at the UW. I now want get into the js bootcamp to work towards a career as a developer.  I haven't found a subject I enjoy learning about as much as programming. I want to work where it is a passion rather than a job.

**Hobbies:**

I love to rockclimb, and don't get a chance to go often enough. <http://www.seattleboulderingproject.com/>

**Social Media BS:**

I have a twitter account, which I don't utilize <https://twitter.com/zachx1>

I also have a facebook account.... which I also don't use <https://www.facebook.com/zach.bryan.395>
