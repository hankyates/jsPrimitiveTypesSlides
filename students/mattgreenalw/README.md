###Short History:
I grew up in Boring Oregon where I lived the typical trailer park skater/snowboarder life. I went to college for a couple years after highschool while working full time. That experience was terrible, so I decided to join the Army and live the good life (hahahaha....). 7 years later I am much more prepared and disciplined to take life by the hornes. Right now I am still full time military, primary parent to my three kids, and taking this class! Just keep swimming. Hopefully I will complete the JS bootcamp around the time I am finaly out of the Army and my transition will be seamless. 

Thanks to all the instructors and students in advance for all the help you will give me!
