###IT Manager/SysAdmin

I'm Paul Laskowski. I am looking to change careers and am really excited to learn at Code Fellows. I recently completed the previous Ruby on Rails Night Class and really enjoyed the class. I originally was looking for a Javascript night class in that previous quarter, but that wasn't offered then. But I really wanted to just get started, so I dove into Ruby on Rails instead. In the process of learing RoR, I found that I enjoyed the front end javascript and jQuery work that I added to my project. Thus validating my original idea of taking a JS night class. So here I am.

I really want to take the JS bootcamp but will need **a lot of encouragement** to take the leap of faith into dumping my current IT job to allow time for concentrating on a bootcamp. Come discuss your success stories with me and help me be more mindful of the likelihood of having a decent paying job on the other end of a bootcamp. 

:)


Looking forward to working and learning with everyone.
