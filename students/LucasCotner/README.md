My name is Lucas Cotner and this is a quick bio! My background is in GIS (think computer mapping) and I got into JavaScript developing web mapping applications. They are really fun, but I didn't know quite enough JavaScript to get the best out of them, so I need a more structured JavaScript education! I love to code.
