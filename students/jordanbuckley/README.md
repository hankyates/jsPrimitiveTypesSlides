My name is [Jordan Buckley](https://twitter.com/jbkly). I'm from Seattle but I've lived in some other places, like:

- [Maine](http://cdn2.collective-evolution.com/assets/uploads/2013/11/lobster.jpeg)
- [Alabama](http://www.therooster.com/sites/default/files/RollTide.jpg)
- [Kentucky](http://www.louisville.com/files/u3978/360x450xbourbon.jpg,q1308072662.pagespeed.ic.rnqlGy8j9a.jpg)
- [Scotland](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YEofdUhE7fE/UPNACNeO0KI/AAAAAAAAhf8/gU0zmqmNSVA/s640/kilts3.jpg)

I studied history in college, linguistics for my master's degree, and now I work as an editor for a blog. 

I really love new technologies and the web, and I've dabbled in code over the years, but now I'm working toward changing careers and getting into web/software development. I'm interested in user experience design, web applications, and Android development.
