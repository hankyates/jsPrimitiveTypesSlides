+ ####An 'about me' & why I'm taking this class:####
     I have always had a passion for taking a seemingly incomprehensible or foreign material and slowly hacking away at it's parts and kinks in order to creatively use it. I received my Bachelors from University of Washington, about two years ago, with a major in Japanese language/linguistics and a minor in Technical-business Japanese. Unfortunately, I haven't found much fulfilling work at my current skill-set. 

    Therefore, I decided to take a leap of faith and try applying my natural above stated passions towards web development. I am ecstatic about giving it my full attention and focus. I hope to gain a solid foundation in JavaScript by taking this class. From there, I hope I will be accepted into the JavaScript boot-camp. 

+ ####Interests (Outside of programming):####
	- Playing video games
		- Currently playing: FTL Advanced Edition & Fez
	- Cooking
	- Watching media on my Roku
	- Espresso connoisseur
		- Favorite drink order: espresso macchiato (traditional) on the dry-side.
