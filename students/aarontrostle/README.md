### About me

Hey there! My name is [Aaron Trostle](http://aarontrostle.com/about). I am currently a **ruby on rails** developer working on a product called [Ares Builder](http://www.aresbuilder.com). I am in the JS Foundations class to continue my journey with Javascript. I hope to learn more about building and maintaining larger client side JS applications. We currently use **backbone.js** at Ares Builder and I want to expand my knowledge of that and get some more general JS experience and experience with other frameworks like Angular.

In my free time you can find me at my apartment working on code or video games (a newly acquired interest). If I am not there I might be working at the [screen printing shop](http://unauthorizedprints.com) that I helped start a few years back.

I love building things and I love the web. Thanks for reading!
